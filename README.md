Let me introduce, the AI Art Director !
If you‚Äôve ever processed hundreds of RAW photos, you know the pain: post-processing quickly becomes a time sink.
What if an AI agent could do it for you?

The agent workflow is pretty simple :
The user inputs an image and the desired vibe : dreamy, sunny, badass, ...
A couple of llm, the art director, analyze the input image and the user's desire and deduce what filters should be applied and with which intensity : a lot, barely, ...
The agent interprets these directions and uses internal tools (12 tools) to apply the effects.
A Vision-Language Model (VLM) critic reviews the result and suggests improvements.
This process is repeated at most 5 times.

 Built with:

smolagent (agent orchestration)
Nebius endpoints (tool hosting)

Hackathon track:
Agent Demo Track
